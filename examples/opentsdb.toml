## metric_batch_size metrics.
## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.

## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.

## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.

## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices

## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
## flush_interval + flush_jitter
flush_interval = "10s"
## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s

## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s".
##
## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"

## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
